The Gradebook Analyzer is a Python-based program designed to manage and analyze student grade data efficiently. It allows users to input student details such as names, subjects, and marks, and then stores this information securely in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file for easy access and future analysis.

This assignment focuses on practical file handling and data manipulation using Python’s built-in CSV module. The program emphasizes user interaction, data persistence, and structured data management.
